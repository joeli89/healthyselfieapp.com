	                    	The selfie provides an objective perspective of your body. Whether you’re looking to lose weight or gain size, it’s the ultimate motivation to get you going.
							How do you know you’ve progressed if you don’t keep a record? Selfies are the most intuitive way of tracking your body’s progression. Knowing that you have your next Selfie coming up prevents you going off track and allows you to visualise small changes.

	                    	You are what you eat, so why not keep a food diary? The traditional process of keeping a food diary is boring and timely, so we decided it would be easier to simply take photos of what you’re eating instead. 
							Made something you’re proud of? Do more than just take a photo - input the recipe and ingredients  so that others can try it out too! Sharing healthy food ideas has never been easier!

	                    	  showed that ’social-dieters’ lose more weight. Community based dieting also inspires members to 
	                    	  exercise harder and more frequently! So what we’re saying is this - for the best results, inspire
	                    	   others and be inspired.
